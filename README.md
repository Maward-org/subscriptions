This is an enhancement to the built-in Subscription model in ERPNext, allowing you to manage annual subscription plans more flexibly. You can set the annual subscription amount, and the system will automatically calculate the monthly cost if monthly payments are selected. Additionally, it enables the generation of multiple invoices throughout the year based on the defined billing cycle
